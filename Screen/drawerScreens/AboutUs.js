Hence buying the PV system off the shelf without worrying about quality, reliability and market standards is still not possible. Most Solar adopters have different focus area or expertise and having a paid consultancy is not economical always, which leaves Solar Adopters wondering how to go about it, what to buy, how to buy and make sure that the asset has a good design and operating life.', image: require('../../Images/about1.png') },

Many times, need of the individuals, families and businesses for electric power drive them to adopt sustainable energy resources. Solar technologies have not only become readily available but also have become super affordable. However, accessibility is little challenging as there are multiple factors and stakeholders involved in the adoption process. At eSunScope our objective is to link the stakeholders in the value chain, reduce the cost at every touch point and help them to adopt renewable energy through single IT enabled platform.', image: require('../../Images/about2.png') },
